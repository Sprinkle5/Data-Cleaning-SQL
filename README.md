## Data-Cleaning-SQL
Using housing dataset to clean with SQL Server
The data was collected from Alex the Analyst GitHub as an .xlsx file on Nashville Housing data
This was a data cleaning project that included standardizing date formats, populated addresses for NULL values, 
separating address into 3 columns (address, city, and state), changing characters to text, removing duplicates,
and deleting unwanted columns. 

## Data-Exploration-SQL
In this project I explored a Covid 19 dataset in SQL Server that ranged from February 2020 to April 2022 from Authors: Hannah Ritchie, Edouard Mathieu, Lucas Rod√©s-Guirao, Cameron Appel, Charlie Giattino, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, Joe Hasell, Bobbie Macdonald, Diana Beltekian and Max Roser (2020) - "Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19)".

## Data-Correlation-Python
In this project I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle, Movie Industry (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies).  It is a public availabile dataset that was collected by Daniel Grijalva (Owner), who collected the data by scraping the HTML of IMDb using Python script.  The dataset contains 6,820 movies from 1986-2016 that contain 15 different attributes.  Using Python I cleaned and analyzed the dataset to look for correlations.
