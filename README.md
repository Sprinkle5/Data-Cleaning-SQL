# Data-Cleaning-SQL
Using housing dataset to clean with SQL Server
The data was collected from Alex the Analyst GitHub as an .xlsx file on Nashville Housing data
This was a data cleaning project that included standardizing date formats, populated addresses for NULL values, 
separating address into 3 columns (address, city, and state), changing characters to text, removing duplicates,
and deleting unwanted columns.
